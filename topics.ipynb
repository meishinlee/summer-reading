The Painted Man, book one of the Demon Cycle, is a captivating and thrilling fantasy adventure, pulling the reader into a world of demons, darkness and heroes.  AS DARKNESS FALLS, THE DEMONS RISE For hundreds of years these creatures have terrorized the night, slowly culling the human population. It was not always this way. Men and women did not always cower behind protective magical wards and hope to see the dawn. Once, they battled the demons on equal terms, but those days, and skills, are gone. Arlen Bales lives with his parents on their isolated farmstead until a demon attack shatters their world. He learns a savage lesson that day: that people, as well as magic, can let you down. Rejecting the fear that kills as efficiently as the creatures, Arlen risks another path in order to offer humanity a last, fleeting chance of survival.",

Jane's class think that wearing the 'right' label clothing is very important, and her classmates start to make fun of her: 'What a fleabag!', 'Where did you get that coat - the Oxfam shop?' Jane wishes she didn't have to go to school; she is beginning to dread each new day. Michael isn't good at football. The other boys make fun of him, banging into him 'accidentally' and tripping him up when the games teacher isn't looking. Michael's mum wonders why he's always covered in bruises, but Michael won't say.Bullying encompasses many things: being called names, being beaten up, having your bus fare stolen, being made to feel stupid... It's always horrible. Almost everyone gets bullied at some point in their life; often it happens at school. But you don't have to accept being bullied, and if you're a bully, you can learn to stop. This book explores why some people bully, why others are bullied and what you can do to change things.",

            "name": "The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he is a fearsome T-Rex stalking his victim through the Jurassic jungle. He is in thrall to consumerism, hates school, loves making gruesome snowmen, and plays Calvinball, an anarchic game of ever-changing rules.  Yet he is also given to philosophising about the big issues of life, ably supported or gently undermined by Hobbes's quietly caustic asides (the tiger's name is no coincidence). Here is an outlet for Watterson's deeply-held views about the craziness of the modern world; indeed, the artist himself has always shunned publicity.  The strip is also enhanced by its strong cast of supporting characters. Mrs Wormwood the teacher looms over Calvin when he not paying attention; the school bully (who calls Calvin Twinky) is always on hand to 'pound' him; Susie, the little girl from down the road, often gets her own back on her snowball-throwing nemesis.  Calvin's dad is a particularly funny creation: long-suffering, anti-media, and a proponent of fresh air, he also manages to get his revenge on his manic son by tying him up in mental knots with spurious bits of information (for example, he tells Calvin that old photographs are black and white because the world comprised only those colours in the past).  All these ingredients would, in the right hands, combine to make a perfectly good comic strip, but what always put Calvin and Hobbes ahead of the competition was the sheer artistry of Watterson's illustrations. In this regard, the chronological arrangement of the strips usefully shows Watterson's increasingly sophisticated technique, from his drawings of desert canyons and hideous inhabitants of alien planets, to the facial expressions of all his characters.  It is hard to deny that Watterson owes a debt to Charles Schulz, whose Peanuts strip also offered a sophisticated yet deceptively simple evocation of the inner lives of children. For Calvin and Hobbes, however, Watterson combined uncanny ability, more than a touch of surrealism and a huge dose of humour to distil the essence of late-twentieth-century childhood, thereby elevating his strip into a league of its own.",

         "Desc": "Practical advice for children on how to handle bullying. Jane's class think that wearing the 'right' label clothing is very important, and her classmates start to make fun of her: 'What a fleabag!', 'Where did you get that coat - the Oxfam shop?' Jane wishes she didn't have to go to school; she is beginning to dread each new day. Michael isn't good at football. The other boys make fun of him, banging into him 'accidentally' and tripping him up when the games teacher isn't looking. Michael's mum wonders why he's always covered in bruises, but Michael won't say.Bullying encompasses many things: being called names, being beaten up, having your bus fare stolen, being made to feel stupid... It's always horrible. Almost everyone gets bullied at some point in their life; often it happens at school. But you don't have to accept being bullied, and if you're a bully, you can learn to stop. This book explores why some people bully, why others are bullied and what you can do to change things.",

         "Desc": "The comic-strip adventures of Calvin, a naughty boy with a philosophical bent, and his soft toy tiger companion Hobbes, delighted readers from 1985 to 1995. The huge achievement of the comic's creator Bill Watterson is celebrated here in this wonderful cloth-bound three-volume box set, which contains in chronological order every Calvin and Hobbes strip.  For those who have never experienced the sheer delight of Watterson's creation, here is a brief summary: Calvin is an active and imaginative little boy; his friend Hobbes appears as a stuffed tiger when other people are around, but when the two of them are alone he comes to life and is Calvin's friend and playmate. They live with Calvin's long-suffering parents, who have to cope with his turbulent behaviour.  The charm of the strip is multi-faceted. On the one hand, Calvin is a typical six-year-old with a vivid imagination: one minute he is fearless intergalactic traveller Spaceman Spiff, crash-landing on a hostile planet, the next he…",

As a consequence, its gentle nature is twisted and distorted until it becomes a veritable monster, wreaking havoc and bringing death and destruction in its wake.\nThis remarkable new version blends the finest contemporary illustration, dramatic storytelling and superb paper engineering. A combination of comic strip detail and stunning pop-ups on every spread bring each moment of the story to life, from the monster's creation to his dramatic demise.",

One day, after the bullies throw her bag in the middle of a huge patch of stinging nettles, Nick Underbridge comes to her aid - a strange boy that everyone makes fun of at school for his hugeness and odd, unidentifiable smell. \nAs Frank and Nick become friends, Frank discovers something strange and wonderful in Nick's basement - and an explanation for what holds him apart from the others at school.\nA sometimes sad and sometimes wry tale of bullying and fitting in, The Song From Somewhere Else is also a magical tale about how - sometimes - people might feel alien to us, but that families are universal, whoever you are.\nLevi Pinfold's stunning, intricate and moody illustrations add an extra layer of atmosphere to this heartfelt and beautifully strange story.\nWinner of the Kate Greenaway Amnesty CLIP Honour in 2018.",

It is a guide on how to live well, like a knight: staying wise, humble, courageous, loving and kind.\nHawke has tried to make this book look as authentic as possible. The cover stands out with a gold-embossed leaf. Inside, an editor’s note talks about the discovery of the ‘historical’ letter, confirming Sir Thomas's death at the Battle of Slaughter Bridge in 1483.It all gives the book an important and timeless feel. Hawke has a way with a sentence, and many of the sections read like note-perfect proverbs. There are also some lovely, tender scenes with the grandfather. It can be a little dense at times, so children may want to dip in and out of the short, standalone chapters. But the book is pitched in such a way that they can get new meaning from it as they grow into teenagers and young adults.",

As the Goddess embodied, she can kill with a single touch. Only the prince, with his royal blood, is immune to her touch, but even he avoids her. Then a new guard arrives, one with an easy smile that belies his deadly swordsmanship. He sees past the executioner robes to the girl beneath, and a friendship blossoms between him and Twylla, a friendship that could be more if Twylla wasn't promised to the prince. But her romantic problems are trivial when she discovers the mad plan that the power-hungry and vicious queen is plotting. As everything begins to spiral out of control, Twylla has to decide who she trusts, who she loves, and what she is willing to do for her kingdom.\nThe Sin Eater's Daughter is a truly original fantasy set in a richly imagined world full of complex and complicated characters.

Her new book Holding Up the Universe is suitable for younger teens as well - and just as powerfully written.\nThe book is narrated in turns by Libby, famous for once being 'America's Fattest Teen' and starting high school after years of being home schooled, and Jack, who seems to be one of the popular kids but secretly suffers from Prospagnosia - the inability to recognise the faces of familiar people even those in this own family which is often called 'face blindness'. Their worlds collide in a horribly cruel high school game and an unlikely friendship is formed that leads to something even deeper.\nJennifer Niven is a gorgeous writer.

Although the two plots that make up the book are essentially simple, the care with which Ware has executed them gives them an almost mythic quality. Jimmy Corrigan is a lonely, single, thirty-something with a boring job in an office cubicle, and a domineering mother who, in spite of living in a nursing home, is never far from the telephone or Jimmy. His crippling shyness renders him incapable of even saying hello to Peggy, the woman who works at an adjacent desk. When the father he has never known sends him an invitation and a plane ticket, Jimmy feels compelled to fly out to meet him.  Jimmy's (by and large disastrous) trip is mirrored by the boyhood tale of his grandfather, James, whose relationship with his father is tainted by unhappiness. (It's not as confusing as it sounds.)

The Earth follows shortly afterwards to make way for a new hyperspace express route, and his best friend has just announced that he's an alien. At this moment, they're hurtling through space with nothing but their towels and an innocuous-looking book inscribed, in large friendly letters, with the words: DON'T PANIC. The weekend has only just begun . . .Follow Arthur Dent's galactic (mis)adventures in the rest of the trilogy with five parts: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe and Everything, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, and Mostly Harmless.",

The Painted Man, book one of the Demon Cycle, is a captivating and thrilling fantasy adventure, pulling the reader into a world of demons, darkness and heroes.  AS DARKNESS FALLS, THE DEMONS RISE For hundreds of years these creatures have terrorized the night, slowly culling the human population. It was not always this way. Men and women did not always cower behind protective magical wards and hope to see the dawn. Once, they battled the demons on equal terms, but those days, and skills, are gone. Arlen Bales lives with his parents on their isolated farmstead until a demon attack shatters their world. He learns a savage lesson that day: that people, as well as magic, can let you down. Rejecting the fear that kills as efficiently as the creatures, Arlen risks another path in order to offer humanity a last, fleeting chance of survival.",

Caz hasn’t seen her father for nine years, when the Blue Star poisoned and froze the planet. She can’t let go of the feeling that he may still be alive somewhere, and when she finds a secret file containing information about him, she’s determined to investigate. Caz and Will soon find themselves out in the frozen landscape once again, and it’s even more dangerous than last time.\nThis is a fantastic sequel for this dystopian series, keeping the fast pace of At the World’s End. It will certainly leave the reader asking for more.",

The Earth follows shortly afterwards to make way for a new hyperspace express route, and his best friend has just announced that he's an alien. At this moment, they're hurtling through space with nothing but their towels and an innocuous-looking book inscribed, in large friendly letters, with the words: DON'T PANIC. The weekend has only just begun . . .Follow Arthur Dent's galactic (mis)adventures in the rest of the trilogy with five parts: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the Universe and Everything, So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, and Mostly Harmless.",

Then a new guard arrives, one with an easy smile that belies his deadly swordsmanship.

But her romantic problems are trivial when she discovers the mad plan that the power-hungry and vicious queen is plotting.
